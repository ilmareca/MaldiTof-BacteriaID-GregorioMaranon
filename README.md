# Project: MALDI-TOF Spectra Analysis for Bacterial Identification and Antibiotic Resistance Prediction

This project focuses on the analysis of bacterial spectra obtained using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The goal is to predict both the bacterial species and genus, with a specific focus on predicting antibiotic resistance for the **Klebsiella pneumoniae** bacterium. The pipeline applies to multiple datasets, including those from the **Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara√±√≥n (HGUGM)** and publicly available databases like **DRIAMS** and **RKI**. These external datasets are used to validate and improve prediction accuracy across various bacterial strains.

## üõ†Ô∏è Pipeline Steps

1. **Raw Data Loading**: The raw spectral data is collected from **HGUGM** and public datasets (**DRIAMS** and **RKI**), located in `1_raw_data/raw_files`.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning and noise removal are applied to the spectra using scripts in `2_data_cleaning/scripts`.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries and visualizations are generated in `3_data_statistics/scripts` to understand the data distribution and patterns.
4. **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and transformations are performed in `4_data_preprocessing/scripts`.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Machine learning models are trained in `5_modeling/scripts` to:
    - Predict the bacterial **genus** and **species**.
    - Predict the **antibiotic resistance status** for **Klebsiella pneumoniae** strains.
